# Test assignment Senior/Architect

Create a solution for the following use case:
A customer brings a suit that needs altering (shorten sleeves, shorten trousers). A salesrep needs a way to enter these alterations. Once the payment for the alteration has been received, a tailor will pick up the suit and do the alterations. When he is finished, the customer will be notified that the suit is ready to be picked up.

## Business requirements:

2 possible alterations:
* Shorten sleeves (left and/or right), can be up to + or – 5 cm
* Shorten trousers (left and/or right), can be up to + or – 5 cm

A tailor can only start after payment has been received. Payment is done on a register by looking up the customer and then select an alteration from a list of unpaid alterations for that customer.
The salesrep or tailor should be able to get an overview of what alterations are created, paid or done.

## Prerequisites:

An **OrderPaid** message is published to an Azure Topic, containing the identifier of the alteration. You may assume that it’s there, just provide a method/function/something that will process the message.

The notification is done by an email service. It will listen for an **AlterationFinished** event on an Azure Service Bus. No need to actually publish it.

Customer data is not part of this application.

## Technical Requirements
* Use best practices and design patterns 
* The solution will be deployed on Azure, use any Azure technology you like
* You may use any publicly Nuget package available
* Add logging to Azure Insights
* UI can be simple, just some interface for entering an alteration and an overview of alterations
* Automation tests (Unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
